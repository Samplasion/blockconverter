# BlockConverter

**A simple Nintendo Block to MB/GB converter.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

> This app contains a Dark Mode. To use it, go to the app's directory, go to `resources\app\` and edit the `index.html` file to link to the `style-dark.css` stylesheet rather than `style.css`.

## How To Use

To clone and test this software, you'll need **[Git](https://git-scm.com)**, **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)** (which comes with **[npm](http://npmjs.com)**) and **[electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)** installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/samplasion/blockconverter
# Go into the repository
cd blockconverter
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Alteratively, you can build and run this software, by doing:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/samplasion/blockconverter
# Go into the repository
cd blockconverter
# Build the app
electron-packager .
```

You'll find the software in `blockconverter-out`.This is particularly useful, as it builds an `.exe` ready to use.

Finally, there's a prebuilt `.exe` **[here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/eqv1fnmmdsc7xg6/BlockConverter-win32-x64.rar)**.
